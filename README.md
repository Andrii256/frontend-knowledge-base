# ideas
- make topic at dou
- write to Roman, Nemchinsky, Makeev and another famous people with ask for promotion
- docs chapters
    - I want contribute
    - I wanted see output
    - FAQs
- integration with pocket and etc
- roadmap with links in filters
- create presets of filters and generate its h1
- add opportunity for logging in and voting. But do it wisely, not just much people. Maybe categorize them by expertness levels. Verify it by different certificates or etc achivements.
- add opportunity for every user to create its own private knowledge base entries
- add textaria to get custom callback inside filter
- different languages
- add 'history' into docs folder
- make docs folder as `obsidian` vault.
- create vscode or webstorm extension
- prepare trello board with how to contribute
- think about further steps
- create full maps of categories
- rewrite it for make it more lightweight for big amount of items, divide .json file for more separate files

# pages ideas
- entry constructor (where user can just fill data and get ready JSON code)
- list of moderators
- docs, I can render it from .md files too

# docs structure
- how to contribute
- moderators and contributors
